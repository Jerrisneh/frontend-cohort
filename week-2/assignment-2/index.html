      <!-- short description -->
      <p>
        Making fried rice with chicken involves stir-frying cooked chicken,
        vegetables, and day-old rice in a large pan or wok, seasoning it with
        soy sauce and other aromatics. For fried chicken, pieces are typically
        coated in a seasoned flour or batter mixture and then pan-fried or
        deep-fried until golden and cooked through.
