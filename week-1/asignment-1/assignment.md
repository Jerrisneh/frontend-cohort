The one website i use regularly is github, it is a very interesting web application especially for developers, i use it to create online folders to store my projects, as i journey in tech from my start to even as i build more and i find it very interesting because it is user friendly, has a seamless interface and allows users to store their codes and project for others to be able to collaborate as well. It is a web app that provides user interactivity and version control for collaboration and it also allows users to participate in discussion and work together remotely.
I hope to build a good portfolio and projects to increase my knowledge on the frontend technologies.
I am so excited to learn about frontend frameworks like react as a javascript framework which is one the highly used javascript frameworks, and i heard it is there to make javascript easier but why is it then harder and other frameworks if available as well. Well the aspect of frontend i am nervous about is the functionality aspect like making the website come to live using either vanilla js or its framework and thats the same aspect i want to learn about.

Exploring website using developer tool to inspect i noticed on a website i inspected there things i didn’t understand and it was interesting to me because i want to know them, things like data-component, data-wrap, data-view, mt-1,mb-1,user_id,resource_id etc i didn’t know what language exactly they were if they are javascript,css,html,react or tailwind or all of the above etc. yes i saw classes and comments and alt. I didn’t understand many things
